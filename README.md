# Deploy-ready Social Chat (React + Next.js + Firebase)

This repository is a minimal, deploy-ready social chat app that meets your requirements:

1. Users enter via a URL.
2. On entry they input a number (their ID) to identify themselves.
3. Users can post text messages.
4. Users see others' messages in real time.

Built with Next.js (React) and Firebase Firestore (real-time listeners). Deploy to Vercel for a frictionless experience.

## Features
- No signup: user identifies by entering a numeric ID.
- Realtime updates via Firestore `onSnapshot`.
